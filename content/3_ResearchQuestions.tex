\chapter{Research Questions}
\label{ch:rq}
This thesis should for example help to answer the following questions regarding a multi-sensor 3D Object detector based on a Transformer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is happening inside the Transformer on the current input sequence ?
    \item What did the Transformer learn ?
    \item What did the Transformer see in the multi-sensor data stream ?
    \item Where is the Transformer ”looking” at ?
    \item Which sensor(s) is(are) responsible for the current detection ?
  \end{itemize}
