\section{Explainable AI}
%Describe Explainable AI in general and why it is important for automotive
A machine learning model is trained with a given dataset and is used for making predictions.
Often the model is viewed as a "black box", in which only the input and the predictions are visualized. 
However, very often we need to understand the reasoning behind the model, i.e what did it learn during the training process.
This is clearly motivated when the safety of people is influenced by the AI \cite{abeloos2022explaining}.
The techniques used to explain the predictions made by the AI and make them more interpretable are referred to as Explainabel AI (XAI).


\section{Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection}
%Describe 3D Object detection and multi-modal object detection
Autonomous driving is progressing towards self-driving cars at an accelerating speed. One of the main difficulties is due to
the complex and dynamic driving environment \cite{wang2021multi}.
